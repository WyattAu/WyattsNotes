## Maximizing Hit
### Initial Sequence
Usage of initial sequence can help maximizing hit rate for both letter and position. It is important to acknowledge that the initial sequence should be discontinued any time when an educated guess is possible.

As suggested by Grant Sanderson, the best opener would be *CRANE*, with *SLIPT* as a follow up. After that I would recommend *JUMBY*, covering vowel *U*, semi-vowel *Y* and common consonants *J*, *M*, *B*. If there still isn't any hits, I recommend *VOZHD*, targeting the remaining vowel *O*, and the common consonants *D* *H*.
