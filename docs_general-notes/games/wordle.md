## Maximizing Hit

### Initial Sequence

Usage of initial sequence can help maximizing hit rate for both letter and position. It is important to acknowledge that the initial sequence should be discontinued any time when an educated guess is possible.

As suggested by Grant Sanderson, the best opener would be _CRANE_, with _SLIPT_ as a follow up. After that I would recommend _JUMBY_, covering vowel _U_, semi-vowel _Y_ and common consonants _J_, _M_, _B_. If there still isn't any hits, I recommend _VOZHD_, targeting the remaining vowel _O_, and the common consonants _D_ _H_.
