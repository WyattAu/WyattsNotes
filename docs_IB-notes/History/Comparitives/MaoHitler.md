| Public Reception       |               Great Depression (after Wall Street Crash in 1929) created an environment aiding extremist ideologies to address mass unemployment, social unrest, deteriorating living conditions. Hitler emphasize the ideas of Lebensraum (living space), arguing for nationalist expansionism                | Feudalism and warlord system had long exploited rural peasants, the emphasis of replacing proletariat with peasantry lead revolution garnered many support. This support was increased when the promise of land redistribution was proposed. However, support was greatly reduce after the Great Leap Forward failed. Historian Paul Clark describe the excessive use of Cultural Revolution instead of an organic growth showcase a dangerous deviation between working-class and democratic planning, and may lead to destabilizing of the country. |

| Propaganda based | Promotion of Mao's cult of personality, including: regular rallies and distribution of Mao's Little Red Book (Quotations from Chairman Mao) | Establishment of Aryan supremacy, anti-Semitism, and Fuhrerprinzip (Fuhrer principle), through: Nuremberg Rallies (Annual mass gatherings showcasing military and unity), Lowered the cost of small range radios and enable public broadcast to promote propaganda radio channels, Emphasis on symbols (swastika) and slogans ("Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Fuhrer") |
| Education        | Curriculum focus on Mao's interpretation of Marxist-Leninism and anti-imperialism, class struggles, through re-education campaigns during Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) | Book Burnings (1933), Hitler Youth (Mandatory membership by 1939) ideological indoctrination |
| Police state | Less significant in China, Frank dikotter argues the overhead due to large geological span of China makes this difficult, punished through Laogai (Labor camps) | Gestapo, SS, punished through concentration camps. Example being the (Nacht und Nebel) Night and Fog Decree (1941), Night of the Long Knives (1934) |
|Suppression | Public executions during pidou (struggle sessions), a significant death being chairman Liu Shaoqi. Another event being Hundred Flowers campaign for luring opposition (supported by historians like Roderick MacFarquhar, while historians such as Merle Goldman believe it was a genuine attempt that backfired and therefore suppressed afterwards). These targets are counter-revolutionists, landlords, and intellectuals | Concentration camps, Mass shootings and Gas Chambers, Eugenics forced sterilization. These targets include Jews, Political opponents, and individuals possessing undesirable phenotypes (Homosexual, disabled) |
