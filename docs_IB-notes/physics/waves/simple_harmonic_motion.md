## Characteristics and Conditions

**Characteristics**
**Simple Harmonic Motion** is periodic motion around a central point of equilibrium, of which there is no net force. There is a restoring force that acts on the object that is directly proportional to the displacement from equilibrium position and acts in a direction opposite to that displacement.

**Equilibrium Position** - it's the position where the net force acting on the object is zero

**Amplitude** - maximum displacement or distance that an oscillating object moves away from its equilibrium position

**Conditions**

- In perfect SHM the oscillations always take the same time.
- There are no resistive forces.
- They continue oscillating indefinitely .
- No loss of energy.
- Constant amplitude.
- Amplitude - the maximum displacement-of the system decreases when it transfers energy to the environment.
- Isochronous - oscillation repeats, taking the same repetition time irrespective of its size.
- Restoring force, $F$, is proportional to the displacement, $x$, but the force always acts back towards the equilibrium position: $F \propto -x$
- The negative sign is important here. It shows us that the force acts in the opposite direction to the displacement: an increasing force opposes increasing displacement.
- Restoring force is a force that acts on an object, attempting to return it to its equilibrium or rest position when it is displaced from that position.
  Another way to put it is: $a \propto -x$ 
- Where acceleration is proportional to the displacement, but in the opposite direction (always directed back towards the equilibrium position).

## Graphs

- Mass oscillating on a spring could be used with a marker pen to produce a record of the oscillation.

- Using knowledge from, velocity of oscillating mass at any moment can be calculated by determining the gradient of the displacement-time graph at that moment.
  $$\text{velocity}, v = \frac{\text{change\ in\  displacement}}{\text{change\  in\  time}} = \frac{\delta x}{\delta t}$$

- Similarly, the acceleration at any time can be calculated.
  $$\text{acceleration}, a = \frac{\text{change\ in\ velocity}}{\text{change\ in\ time}} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$$
- The velocity graph has its maximum value, $v_0$ , when the displacement, $x$, is zero, and the velocity is zero when the displacement is at its maximum, $\pm x_0$ .

- Thus, acceleration can be shown as such.
- As you can notice, the acceleration-time graph is simply an inverted version of the displacement-time graph.
- This is because we had established earlier that acceleration is proportional to negative $x$.
- Acceleration moves in the opposite direction of displacement, to put the mass back in equilibrium.

## The Simple Pendulum

**Equilibrium Position**

**Features**

- Consists of:
  Small mass
  Inextensible string
- If left alone, the mass will hang at rest so that the string is vertical.
- if pushed to one side, it will oscillate about its equilibrium position.
- pendulum oscillates because there is always a force acting toward the centre

**Calculating Period**

- Period - Time of one complete cycle
- Frequency - Cycles in one second
- Length - distance between start of string and ball
- Gravitational Field-Strength/Acceleration - $9.8m/s^2$
  $$ T = 2\pi \sqrt\frac{l}{g}$$
- As length of string increases, period $\uparrow$ increases
- As gravitational acceleration increases, period $\downarrow$ decreases
- The period is independent of the mass of the pendulum bob, which is a remarkable property of simple pendulums.

**Calculating Force & Acceleration**

- The restoring force that pulls the bob back to the equilibrium position is $-mg\space\sin(\theta) = ma = F$
- Negative -mg because the restoring force is in the opposite direction of the angle (which is positive).
- $m$ can be cancelled out, leaving $a = -g\sin(\theta)$
- The magnitude of the acceleration of the body in simple harmonic motion is proportional to the displacement and the direction of the acceleration is towards the equilibrium position.
- This can be shown in $a = -\omega^2x$
- $x$ = displacement
- $-w^2$ = angular frequency
- Due to the equation for displacement at a given time, it can potentially also be written as $a = -\omega^2x_0 \cos(\omega t) = -\omega^2$

## Calculating Displacement & Velocity

- $x = x_0 \cos(\omega t)$ for simple harmonic motion that begins at the extremes.
- $x = x_0 \sin(\omega t)$ for simple harmonic motion that begins at the centre.
- $x = x_0 \sin(\omega t+\Phi)$ can be used for a different phase angle.
- Where $x$ is displacement/amplitude and $x_0$ is initial displacement/amplitude. Therefore $x$ is a modified version of $x_0$ based on the sin/cosine function and degrees=(angular frequency x time).
- Velocity (x unknown): $v = \omega x_0\space \cos(\omega t)$
- Velocity (t unknown): $v = \pm \omega \sqrt {x_0^2-x^2}$
- For where x is unknown, if velocity wants to be found at a different phase angle, the following can be used: $v=\omega x_0\space\cos(\omega t+\Phi )$

## Mass-Spring System

**Features**

1. Mass
2. Spring
   **Hooke's Law**

- The law states that the force required to extend or compress a spring by some distance is directly proportional to that distance.
- This can be mathematically expressed as: $F = -kx$
- $F$ = force (N)
- $k$ = spring constant (N/m)
- $x$ = displacement from equilibrium (m)
  **Calculating Period**
- Equation for period in seconds is:$ T = 2\pi \sqrt\frac{m}{k}$
- $m$ = mass (kg)
- $k$ = spring constant (N/m)

## **Describing and Calculating Energy Changes**

**Kinetic Energy**

- The general formula for kinetic energy is:
  $$ E_K = \frac12mv^2$$
- And the equation for velocity is: $v = \pm\omega \sqrt {x_0^2-x^2}$
- It can be substituted to make: $E_K = \frac{12}{m} \omega(x_0^2-x^2)$
- Kinetic energy is a maximum at the bottom of the swing where x = 0.
- So at the bottom of the swing: $E_K\\\space_m\\_a\\_x = \frac{1}{2}mw^2x^2_0$
- At this point, the potential energy is zero.
- In addition, since v can also be: $v = \omega x_0\space \cos(\omega t)$
- Kinetic energy can be alternatively expressed as: $E_K = \frac{1}{2}mw^2x^2_0\cos^2(\omega t)$
- This can be graphically represented as

**Total Energy**

- The total energy at any moment in time is given by: $ \text{total energy} = E_T = E_K + E_P$
- Therefore at the bottom of the swing: $E_T = \frac{1}{2}mw^2x^2_0+0 = \frac{1}{2}mw^2x^2_0$
- Where 0 = potential energy.
- Since no work is done on the system, according to the law of conservation of energy, the total energy must be constant.
- So: $E_T = \frac{1}{2}mw^2x^2_0$
- This can be graphically represented as:

**Potential Energy**

- Potential energy at any moment = total energy- kinetic energy
- Therefore the two equations for potential energy can be subbed in as:
- $E_P = (\frac{1}{2}mw^2x^2_0) - (\frac{12}{m} \omega(x_0^2-x^2))$
- This can be further simplified as: $E_P = \frac{1}{2}mw^2 x^2$
- This can be graphically represented as
- WHEN U WAKE FINISH POT ENG THEN SPRING THEN MOVE TO C.2

## Angular Frequency

**Definition**

- The rate of change of phase in a periodic waveform
- Typically measured in radians per second (rad$-^1$)

**Equation**

- $\omega$ = angular frequency $\omega = 2\pi f  = \frac{2\pi}{T}$
- $1\space rad =\frac{180 \degree}{\pi}(= 57.3 \degree)$

**Examples**
When a guitar string was plucked (once) it oscillated with a frequency of 196Hz.

- 1. Determine the angular frequency of this oscillation.
- 2. Suggest how you would expect the frequency and amplitude to change in the next few seconds. Explain your answer

1. $\omega = 2\pi f$
   Where:

   - $\omega$ is the angular frequency in radians per second (rad/s).
   - f is the frequency in hertz (Hz).

   In your case, the frequency (f) is given as 196 Hz. So, you can calculate $\omega$ as follows:

   $\omega = 2\pi \times 196Hz$
   $\omega \approx 1234.73 rad/s$

2. After being plucked, the guitar string will likely experience a gradual decrease in both frequency and amplitude.
   The frequency will drop due to energy loss (air resistance) and damping, resulting in a softer and less sustained sound.
   Additionally, the higher harmonics may become less audible over time.

## Phase Angle and Phase Difference

**Phase Angle**

- Represented by $\Phi$
- Measurement of progression of the wave.
- The angle that we start at is arbitrary, but the change stays constant relative to the size of the wave.

**Phase Difference**

- Represented by $\Phi$
- The angle between the radial lines that are tracing out the simple harmonic motion.
- Difference between two phase angles.
- Calculated by $\Phi  = \frac{2\pi\Delta t}{T}$
- In the picture, the phase difference $\Phi $ is 1 rad OR $0.16\degree$
