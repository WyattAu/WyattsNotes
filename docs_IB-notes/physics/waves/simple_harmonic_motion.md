## Characteristics and Conditions
**Characteristics**
**Simple Harmonic Motion** is periodic motion around a central point of equilibrium, of which there is no net force. There is a restoring force that acts on the object that is directly proportional to the displacement from equilibrium position and acts in a direction opposite to that displacement.

**Equilibrium Position** - it's the position where the net force acting on the object is zero

**Amplitude** - maximum displacement or distance that an oscillating object moves away from its equilibrium position

**Conditions**
• In perfect SHM the oscillations always take the same time.
• There are no resistive forces.
• They continue oscillating indefinitely .
• No loss of energy.
• Constant amplitude.
• Amplitude - the maximum displacement—of the system decreases when it transfers energy to the environment.
• Isochronous - oscillation repeats, taking the same repetition time irrespective of its size.
• Restoring force, $F$, is proportional to the displacement, $x$, but the force always acts back towards the equilibrium position: $$F ∝ −x$$
• The negative sign is important here. It shows us that the force acts in the opposite direction to the displacement: an increasing force opposes increasing displacement.
• Restoring force is a force that acts on an object, attempting to return it to its equilibrium or rest position when it is displaced from that position.
Another way to put it is: $$a ∝ -x$$• Where acceleration is proportional to the displacement, but in the opposite direction (always directed back towards the equilibrium position).
## Graphs
• Mass oscillating on a spring could be used with a marker pen to produce a record of the oscillation.

• The graph would appear as such:
![[Pasted image 20231016224531.png]]

• Using knowledge from [[A.2 Forces and Momentum]], velocity of oscillating mass at any moment can be calculated by determining the gradient of the displacement-time graph at that moment.
$$\text{velocity}, v = \frac{\text{change\ in\  displacement}}{\text{change\  in\  time}} = \frac{\delta x}{\delta t}$$
![[Pasted image 20231016224718.png]]

• Similarly, the acceleration at any time can be calculated.
$$\text{acceleration}, a = \frac{\text{change\ in\ velocity}}{\text{change\ in\ time}} = \frac{Δv}{Δt}$$
• The velocity graph has its maximum value, $v_0$ , when the displacement, $x$, is zero, and the velocity is zero when the displacement is at its maximum, $±x_0$ .



• Thus, acceleration can be shown as such.
![[Pasted image 20231016225602.png]]
• As you can notice, the acceleration-time graph is simply an inverted version of the displacement-time graph. 
• This is because we had established earlier that acceleration is proportional to negative $x$. 
• Acceleration moves in the opposite direction of displacement, to put the mass back in equilibrium.

## The Simple Pendulum
**Equilibrium Position**
![[Pasted image 20231021183224.png]]
**Features**
• Consists of:
	Small mass 
	Inextensible string
• If left alone, the mass will hang at rest so that the string is vertical.
• if pushed to one side, it will oscillate about its equilibrium position.
• pendulum oscillates because there is always a force acting toward the centre, as shown in Figure 1
![[Pasted image 20231016230320.png]]

**Calculating Period**
• Period - Time of one complete cycle
• Frequency - Cycles in one second
• Length - distance between start of string and ball
• Gravitational Field-Strength/Acceleration - $9.8m/s^2$ 
$$ T = 2\pi \sqrt\frac{l}{g}$$
• As length of string increases, period $\uparrow$ increases 
• As gravitational acceleration increases, period $\downarrow$ decreases
• The period is independent of the mass of the pendulum bob, which is a remarkable property of simple pendulums.

**Calculating Force & Acceleration**
+ The restoring force that pulls the bob back to the equilibrium position is $$-mg\space\sin(θ) = ma = F$$
+ Negative -mg because the restoring force is in the opposite direction of the angle (which is positive).
+ $m$ can be cancelled out, leaving $$a = -g\sin(\theta)$$
+ The magnitude of the acceleration of the body in simple harmonic motion is proportional to the displacement and the direction of the acceleration is towards the equilibrium position.
+ This can be shown in $$a = -ω^2x$$
+ $x$ = displacement
+ $-w^2$ = angular frequency
+ Due to the equation for displacement at a given time, it can potentially also be written as $$a = -ω^2x_0 \cos(ωt) = -ω^2$$
## Calculating Displacement & Velocity
+ $x = x_0 \cos(ωt)$ for simple harmonic motion that begins at the extremes.
+ $x = x_0 \sin(ωt)$ for simple harmonic motion that begins at the centre.
+ $x = x_0 \sin(ωt+\phi)$ can be used for a different phase angle.
+ Where $x$ is displacement/amplitude and $x_0$ is initial displacement/amplitude. Therefore $x$ is a modified version of $x_0$ based on the sin/cosine function and degrees=(angular frequency x time).
+ Velocity (x unknown): $$v = ωx_0\space \cos(ωt)$$
+ Velocity (t unknown): $$v = ±ω \sqrt {x_0^2-x^2}$$
+ For where x is unknown, if velocity wants to be found at a different phase angle, the following can be used: $$v=ωx_0​\space\cos(ωt+ϕ)$$
## Mass-Spring System
**Features**
1. Mass
2. Spring
![[Pasted image 20231024003557.png]]
**Hooke's Law**
+ The law states that the force required to extend or compress a spring by some distance is directly proportional to that distance.
+ This can be mathematically expressed as: $$F = -kx$$
+ $F$ = force (N)
+ $k$ = spring constant (N/m)
+ $x$ = displacement from equilibrium (m)
**Calculating Period**
+ Equation for period in seconds is:$$ T = 2\pi \sqrt\frac{m}{k}$$
+ $m$ = mass (kg)
+ $k$ = spring constant (N/m)

## **Describing and Calculating Energy Changes**
**Kinetic Energy**
+ The general formula for kinetic energy is:
$$ E_K = \frac12mv^2$$
+ And the equation for velocity is: $$v = ±ω \sqrt {x_0^2-x^2}$$
+ It can be substituted to make: $$E_K = \frac12mω(x_0^2-x^2)$$
+ Kinetic energy is a maximum at the bottom of the swing where x = 0.
+ So at the bottom of the swing: $$E_K\\\space_m\\_a\\_x = \frac{1}{2}mw^2x^2_0$$
+ At this point, the potential energy is zero.
+ In addition, since v can also be: $$v = ωx_0\space \cos(ωt)$$
+ Kinetic energy can be alternatively expressed as: $$E_K = \frac{1}{2}mw^2x^2_0\cos^2(\omega t)$$
+ This can be graphically represented as:![[Pasted image 20231023054212.png]]


**Total Energy**
+ The total energy at any moment in time is given by: $$ \text{total energy} = E_T = E_K + E_P$$
+ Therefore at the bottom of the swing: $$E_T = \frac{1}{2}mw^2x^2_0+0 = \frac{1}{2}mw^2x^2_0$$
+ Where 0 = potential energy.
+ Since no work is done on the system, according to the law of conservation of energy, the total energy must be constant.
+ So: $$E_T = \frac{1}{2}mw^2x^2_0$$
+  This can be graphically represented as: ![[Pasted image 20231023054355.png]]

**Potential Energy** 
+ Potential energy at any moment = total energy- kinetic energy
+ Therefore the two equations for potential energy can be subbed in as:
+ $$E_P = (\frac{1}{2}mw^2x^2_0) - (\frac12mω(x_0^2-x^2))$$
+ This can be further simplified as: $$E_P = \frac{1}{2}mw^2x^2$$
+ This can be graphically represented as: ![[Pasted image 20231023180331.png]]
+ WHEN U WAKE FINISH POT ENG THEN SPRING THEN MOVE TO C.2

## Angular Frequency
**Definition**
+ The rate of change of phase in a periodic waveform
+ Typically measured in radians per second (rad$-^1$)

**Equation** 
+ $\omega$ = angular frequency $$ω = 2πf  = \frac{2π}{T}$$
+ $1\space rad =\frac{180°}{π}(= 57.3°)$

**Examples**
When a guitar string was plucked (once) it oscillated with a frequency of 196Hz. 
+ 1. Determine the angular frequency of this oscillation. 
+ 2. Suggest how you would expect the frequency and amplitude to change in the next few seconds. Explain your answer

1. ω = 2πf
	Where:
	
	- ω is the angular frequency in radians per second (rad/s).
	- f is the frequency in hertz (Hz).
	
	In your case, the frequency (f) is given as 196 Hz. So, you can calculate ω as follows:
	
	ω = 2π * 196Hz 
	ω ≈ 1234.73 rad/s
2.  
	After being plucked, the guitar string will likely experience a gradual decrease in both frequency and amplitude. 
	The frequency will drop due to energy loss (air resistance) and damping, resulting in a softer and less sustained sound. 
	Additionally, the higher harmonics may become less audible over time.

## Phase Angle and Phase Difference 
**Phase Angle**
+ Represented by $\phi$ 
+ Measurement of progression of the wave.
+ The angle that we start at is arbitrary, but the change stays constant relative to the size of the wave.
![[Pasted image 20231023022334.png]]

**Phase Difference**
+ Represented by $\phi$ 
+ The angle between the radial lines that are tracing out the simple harmonic motion.
+ Difference between two phase angles.
+ Calculated by $$\phi = \frac{2\pi\Delta t}{T}$$
+ In the picture, the phase difference $\phi$ is 1 rad OR $0.16\degree$
