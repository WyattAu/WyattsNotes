## Abstract

Inspired by Kevin P. Murphy's series of books on probabilisitc machine learning and Marc Peter's book on Mathematics for Machine Learning. With the ever growing field of machines learning, I will only be able to cover a small portion of what is available, for more detail and up to date appraoches, please refer to latest reports and publications.

## Definition of Probabilistic Machine Learning

This most broad definition of Probabilistic machine learning is the field of ML that represent uncertainty in data and predictions with probability distributions. We will build upon this definition throughout the modules.
