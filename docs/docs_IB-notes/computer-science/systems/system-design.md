## Design

### Prototype

A early model of a system created to showcase a concept or design before release. This is normally useful for:

- Presenting a concept to investors
- Attract client attention
- Encourage participation between users and developers
- Aid in identification of problems early on in a development

## Human Interface

### Usability

Usability is the capacity of a system to accomplish user goals, a combination of accessibility and ergonomics.

#### Accessibility

Accessibility is the range of audience the system is able to be used by, this include lowering the access barrier for disabled individuals with assistance technology.

#### Ergonomics

Ergonomics is the measure of safety and comfortability of the system, including cushioned mouse pad, split keyboard, etc.
