## Objective

1. Deep nuttiness without bitterness (controlled Maillard reactions, not pyrolysis).
2. Maximize conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and butyric acid while minimizing acrylamide/advanced glycation end products (AGEs).
3. Near-zero lactose/casein ($<0.01%$).
4. Account for butter composition variances and ambient storage conditions.
5. Practical usage of standard kitchen tools.

## Ingredients & Tools

| Component | Recommendation                                                                                                                             | Reason                                                                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Butter    | Grass-fed, unsalted, cultured butter (e.g., Kerrygold, Yeo Valley, or Bord Bia).                                                           | Grass-fed: $3-5\times$ more CLA & beta-carotene. Culturing adds depth and lowers lactose.        |
| Equipment | Stainless steel saucepan, digital thermometer ($\pm 1 \degree C$), fine-mesh strainer + unbleached coffee filter/muslin, amber glass jars. | Prevents scorching. Precision avoids overcooking. Removes all solids. Blocks UV light oxidation. |
| Water     | Filtered water (if washing butter)                                                                                                         | Removes residual lactose/proteins without chlorine interference.                                 |

Washing butter (optional but recommended for purity) - melt butter with $20%$ water, cool, solidify, discard water layer. Removes water-soluble impurities.

## Procedure

1. Butter Clarification (Temperature: $100-115\degree C$)
   - Protein denaturation without browning
   1. Cut 500g butter into uniform cubes $\rightarrow$ melt slowly over medium-low heat.
   2. As butter melts, proteins (casein/whey) rise as white foam. Do not stir. Maintain $100-115\degree C$ until:
      - _Visual Cue:_ Foam thickens, bubbles become smaller (5-8 mins).
2. Controlled Caramelization (Temperature: $118-121\degree C$)
   - Deep gold coloring and produce nutty aroma ($118-121\degree C$) - Maillard reaction.
   1. Lower heat $\rightarrow$ simmer uncovered. Critical: Monitor with thermometer.
   2. Milk Solids Sink: Foam collapses $\rightarrow$ solids gather at bottom. Observe color shift:
      - _STOP BEFORE DARK BROWN_ ($\geq 125\degree C$ risks acrylamide).
3. Filtration & Cooling
   1. Remove from heat at golden stage $\rightarrow$ rest 1 min (solids settle).
   2. Strain twice
      1. Through mesh strainer
      2. Then through coffee filter/muslin into jar.
   3. Cool uncovered until $60\degree C$ $\rightarrow$ seal. _Prevents condensation-induced mold._

### Region-Specific Adjustments

<Tabs groupId="region">
  <TabItem value="uk" label="UK">
      1. Butter Selection: UK grass-fed butters (e.g., Kerrygold) have higher moisture than Indian makhan. Extend simmering by $2-3$ mins to evaporate water fully.
      2. Climate Adaptation: Ghee solidifies below $20\degree C$ - store in a dark cupboard (avg. UK home temp: $17-22\degree C$). If liquid preferred, keep jar in warm spot (e.g., near oven).
      3. Water Quality: Hard water can impede foam separation. Use filtered water if pre-washing butter.

### Troubleshooting Guide

| Issue            | Cause                               | Solution                                |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Grainy Texture   | Rapid cooling; impurities           | Strain twice. Cool slowly at room temp. |
| Bitter Notes     | Solids overcooked ($>125\degree C$) | Lower heat; stop at golden (not brown). |
| Cloudy Ghee      | Incomplete straining; moisture      | Re-melt, re-strain with finer filter.   |
| Short Shelf Life | Moisture $>0.1%$                    | Simmer longer after foam subsides.      |

## Conditional Flavouring

- add 1 tsp dried organic rose petals or curry leaves during Phase 2 - strain out before jarring.
