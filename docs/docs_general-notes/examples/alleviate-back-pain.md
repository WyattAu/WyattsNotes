## Objective

This program is a training system designed for casuals, it is expected to be executed three times per week on non-consecutive days (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday). Its primary objective is to build a functional physique that provides postural support, specifically to alleviate associated back pain.

Basic principles:

- Progressive Overload: To stimulate muscle growth and strength adaptation, the demand on the muscles must systematically increase over time. This is achieved by first mastering form, then increasing repetitions, and afterwards, increasing the weight.
- Controlled Tempo: A deliberate pace for each phase of the lift (eccentric (lowering, 5 seconds), pausing at bottom (0 seconds), concentric (lifting, 2 seconds), pause at top (0 seconds)) to ensure stability and eliminating momentum.

## Procedure

### Phase 1: Activation & Stability

Use very light weights or no weight. The goal is precision and muscle engagement, not fatigue.

1. Side-Lying External Rotation

- Target Musculature: Infraspinatus, Teres Minor (Posterior Rotator Cuff).
- Setup: Lie on your side, hips and knees bent. Hold a very light dumbbell in your top hand. Pin the elbow of that arm firmly against your side, creating a 90-degree angle.
- Execution: Keeping your elbow anchored, rotate your forearm upward, lifting the dumbbell toward the ceiling. The movement must originate from the shoulder joint. Pause at the top, then slowly lower to the start.

2. Scapular Push-up

- Target Musculature: Serratus Anterior, Rhomboids, Middle Trapezius.
- Setup: Assume a high plank position with hands directly under your shoulders, arms fully extended. Engage your core and glutes.
- Execution: While keeping your elbows locked, sink your torso by retracting your scapulae (pinching shoulder blades together). Then, powerfully push the floor away, protracting the scapulae (spreading them apart) to create a slight dome in your upper back.

3. Prone Y Raise

- Target Musculature: Lower and Middle Trapezius, Rhomboids.
- Setup: Lie face down on a bench or floor, holding very light dumbbells with a neutral grip (palms facing each other).
- Execution: Initiate by pulling your shoulder blades down and back. With straight arms and thumbs up, raise your arms into a "Y" formation until they are in line with your head. Pause to feel the contraction, then lower with control.

4. Dumbbell Glute Bridge

- Target Musculature: Gluteus Maximus, Hamstrings.
- Setup: Lie on your back, knees bent, feet flat on the floor. Place a dumbbell horizontally across your hips.
- Execution: Brace your core, drive through your heels, and squeeze your glutes to lift your hips until your body is in a straight line from shoulders to knees. Hold the peak contraction for two seconds. Lower with control.

### Phase 2: Primary Strength

Select a weight that makes the final 1-2 repetitions challenging while maintaining perfect form.

5. Bulgarian Split Squat

- Target Musculature: Gluteus Maximus, Quadriceps, Adductors, Core Stabilizers.
- Setup: Stand 2-3 feet before a bench. Hold dumbbells at your sides. Place the top of one foot on the bench behind you.
- Execution: Keep your chest upright and core engaged. Lower your hips vertically toward the floor until your front thigh is parallel to the ground. Your front knee must track in line with your foot. Drive powerfully through the heel of your front foot to return to the start. Complete all reps on one side before switching.

6. Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift (RDL)

- Target Musculature: Hamstrings, Gluteus Maximus, Erector Spinae.
- Setup: Stand with feet hip-width apart, holding dumbbells in front of your thighs. Maintain a constant, slight bend in your knees.
- Execution: Hinge at your hips, pushing your buttocks backward while maintaining a rigid, neutral spine. Keep the dumbbells close to your legs as you lower them. Drive your hips forward to return to standing, squeezing your glutes at the top.

7. Single-Arm Dumbbell Row

- Target Musculature: Latissimus Dorsi, Rhomboids, Trapezius, Biceps.
- Setup: Place one knee and the same-side hand on a flat bench. Your back must be flat and parallel to the floor. Hold a dumbbell in the opposite hand with the arm extended.
- Execution: Brace your core to prevent rotation. Retract your scapula, then drive your elbow up, pulling the dumbbell toward your hip. Squeeze your back muscles at the peak of the contraction before lowering the dumbbell slowly.

8. Dumbbell Bench Press

- Target Musculature: Pectoralis Major, Anterior Deltoids, Triceps.
- Setup: Lie on a bench, feet firmly planted. Retract and depress your scapulae into the bench. Hold dumbbells at the sides of your chest.
- Execution: Press the dumbbells upward and slightly inward, finishing over your sternum. Lower the weights with control, allowing a full stretch in the chest at the bottom without letting your shoulders roll forward.

### Phase 3: Core & Stability

9. Renegade Row

- Target Musculature: Core (anti-rotation), Latissimus Dorsi, Obliques.
- Setup: Assume a high plank position on hexagonal dumbbells. Place your feet wider than hip-width for a stable base.
- Execution: Create total-body tension. Without allowing your hips to rotate or sag, row one dumbbell to your hip. Place it back down with control. Repeat on the other side. This completes one repetition.

10. Russian Twist

- Target Musculature: Internal and External Obliques.
- Setup: Sit in a V-sit position, torso at a 45-degree angle, feet elevated. Hold one dumbbell at your chest.
- Execution: Rotate your entire torso (from the ribcage, not just your arms) to one side and gently touch the dumbbell to the floor beside your hip. Rotate back through the center to the opposite side. Avoid using momentum.

### Phase 4: Post-Workout

The objective is to improve flexibility, facilitate recovery, and decrease muscle soreness. Breathe deeply and do not stretch into pain.

1. Doorway Chest Stretch

- Target Musculature: Pectoralis Major and Minor, Anterior Deltoids.
- Setup: Stand in a doorway. Place your forearms on the frame with elbows bent at 90 degrees, just below shoulder height.
- Execution: Step forward with one foot. Gently lean forward until you feel a comfortable stretch across your chest. Hold the stretch without bouncing.

2. Cat-Cow Stretch

- Target Musculature: Promotes mobility of the entire spinal column.
- Setup: Start on all fours with wrists under shoulders and knees under hips.
- Execution: Inhale as you drop your belly and lift your chest and tailbone (Cow). Exhale as you round your spine, tucking your chin and tailbone (Cat). Flow smoothly between these two poses.

3. Kneeling Hip Flexor Stretch

- Target Musculature: Iliopsoas and Rectus Femoris (hip flexors).
- Setup: Kneel in a lunge position with your rear knee on the ground.
- Execution: Keep your torso upright. Actively squeeze the glute of your rear leg to tuck your pelvis under. This initiates the stretch. For a deeper stretch, gently press your hips forward without arching your back.

4. Supine Hamstring Stretch

- Target Musculature: Hamstring group.
- Setup: Lie on your back with one leg extended towards the ceiling.
- Execution: Grasp the back of your thigh or calf. Gently pull the leg toward you until you feel a moderate stretch. Keep the leg as straight as possible and your lower back pressed into the floor.

## Progression Strategy

- Weeks 1-2: Foundation. Focus exclusively on mastering the technical execution of every exercise with light weights. Form is the only priority.
- Weeks 3+: Progression. Once form is perfect, select a weight that makes the last two repetitions of a set challenging. When you can successfully complete all sets at the -top- of the prescribed repetition range (e.g., 12 reps for the BSS), you have earned the right to increase the weight slightly in your next workout. Continue this cycle.
